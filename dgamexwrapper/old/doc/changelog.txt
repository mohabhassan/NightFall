		* added misc.c and misc.h as a place where we can place our own custom functions, code, structs,
		so the gamex86 related stuff won't get messed up with it
		
		* added 2 new functions: SendGameMessage, BroadcastGameMessage in misc.c
		* added MESSAGE_TYPES for this functions in misc.h
		
		* added some global variables at the beggining of gamex86.c for no-recoil detection
		* added anti-NORECOIL/NO-RECOIL detection code in G_ClientThink (gamex86.c)
		
		* added other global variables like: gi, *globals, globals_backup as 'extern' at the end of gamex86.h
		so we can use them in misc.c for eg.
		
		* moved clientdata_t struct the the bottom of gamex86.h so it's easier to find it and it won't get lost
		between other mohaa structs, since it's our custom struct.
		
		* removed unneeded loop in anti-STWH code (it caused unneeded overload for every client, every frame)
		
		* added some comments
		
		* removed unused variables, decreasing warnings count during compilation
		
		* added detours.lib and detours.h to the folder so people won't need to look for it/download
		and it will be easier to compile without 'missing files' errors
		* commented out #include "detours.h" because we don't need it, but it may be useful later on
		whie developing new functions/reversing

		* fixed NORECOIL detection code
		* added code for getting the weapon class of the weapon used by player

		* fixed string formatting bug in SendGameMessage and BroadcastGameMessage
		
		* added CreateRandomText function to misc.c for generating random cvars, values etc.
		* included <time.h> in misc.h

		* deleted cross-includes between header files that made the compiler run into an infinite loop
		
		* reorganized imports, added linux-spexific imports with ifdef's. Now all C sources include all header files, 
		but header files don't include other header files. Only the gamex86.h is responsible to include all the necessary system libraries, I think it's cleaner this way.
		
		* commented out the definition of sigset_t type in gamex86.h, because it's already defined on linux, and currently unused in the code
		
		* increased BroadcastGameMessage and SendGameMessage buffer size to 4000, because in Q3 source code max message size is 16384
		
		* eliminated compiler warnings: first parameter's type changed from client_t * to int in gi.SendServerCommand and gi.DropClient
		
		* added G_Shutdown to unload original game library and custom signal handler on linux
		
		* added custom signal handler to print stack trace on crash (linux only)
		
		* added some useful functions to misc.c (memory allocation, logging, string manipulation, date/time functions etc.)
